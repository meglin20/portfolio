Part 1
My website displays a portfolio of my design and development work. I convey information about my education, majors, past design and development projects, my hobbies, and my goals. It is interesting and engaging because I utilized the cards so users can click on each project to learn more about them. I also utilized vibrant colors for each project to show the main theme and vibe of the project. The vibrant colors also serve to catch people’s attention. The target audience are those that are interested in my work and want to see the projects I have worked on.

Part 2
Interaction:
1)	Click on the cards on the home page to view the projects
2)	Use the navigation bar (available on all pages), click on any of the links in the nav bar to access a page
3)	Scroll through each project to learn more
4)	Click on the work toggle button on the nav bar and click on a project to go to the project page

Part 3
i.	React JS library
ii.	I chose to use it because it is the most popular JS library and many companies use them to create websites. I believe that the recruiters would be impressed that I created my portfolio using this tool.
iii.	I used it to build the entire website. I took advantage of the React tools, such as using Components and reactstrap. 
Part 4
When I was implementing the website, I realize that the cards would look better if I have the image spans across the entire card and have the text overlay the image instead of having the image be located on one side of the card and the text on the other side. I also got rid of some parts, such as the education part, on the about page since much of the information can already be found on other pages. Removing redundant content also makes the website look clean and minimalistic. 

Part 5
I experience many React specific challenges. I was having difficulty loading pages on the app and I solved it by adding routers. I was also having trouble implementing components and I solved it by following the format shown on the React official website. 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
